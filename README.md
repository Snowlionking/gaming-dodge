# Welcome to the dodge Game

## Goal
In this Game you have to dodge as many Enemies as you can and collect as many point as you can, but with each point collected the Screen gets filled up with more and more enemies.

## Enemies
Currently there are 4 types of enemies (Basic, Fast, Track, Teleport). More Enemies and Bosses will come in future updates
### Basic Enemy
The Basic enemy is very standard, not too fast and not too powerful.
### Fast Enemy
The Fast enemy is compared to the Basic Enemy faster and deadlier.
### Track Enemy
The Track enemy is very slow but extremely powerful. He tracks the player down and is not giving up until he reaches him.
### Teleport Enemy
The Teleport enemy stands completely still, but every 3 seconds teleports to a new location.
